  abstract = {We present the first results of the Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) Muon g - 2 Experiment for the positive muon magnetic anomaly a(mu)  (g(mu) - 2)/2. The anomaly is determined from the precision measurements of two angular frequencies. Intensity variation of high-energy positrons from muon decays directly encodes the difference frequency omega(a) between the spin-precession and cyclotron frequencies for polarized muons in a magnetic storage ring. The storage ring magnetic field is measured using nuclear magnetic resonance probes calibrated in terms of the equivalent proton spin precession frequency (omega) over tilde (p)' in a spherical water sample at 34.7 degrees C. The ratio omega(a)/(omega) over tilde (p)', together with known fundamental constants, determines a(mu)(FNAL) = 116 592 040(54) x 10(-11) (0.46 ppm). The result is 3.3 standard deviations greater than the standard model prediction and is in excellent agreement with the previous Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) E821 measurement. After combination with previous measurements of both mu(+) and mu(-), the new experimental average of a(mu)(Exp) = 116 592 061(41) x 10(-11) (0.35 ppm) increases the tension between experiment and theory to 4.2 standard deviations.},

  abstract = {We present a new measurement of the positive muon magnetic anomaly, a, equivalent to (g,- 2)/2, from the Fermilab Muon g - 2 Experiment using data collected in 2019 and 2020. We have analyzed more than 4 times the number of positrons from muon decay than in our previous result from 2018 data. The systematic error is reduced by more than a factor of 2 due to better running conditions, a more stable beam, and improved knowledge of the magnetic field weighted by the muon distribution, w similar to ip, and of the anomalous precession frequency corrected for beam dynamics effects, wa. From the ratio wa/w similar to ip, together with precisely determined external parameters, we determine a, = 116 592 057(25) x 10-11 (0.21 ppm). Combining this result with our previous result from the 2018 data, we obtain a,(FNAL) = 116592055(24) x 10-11 (0.20 ppm). The new experimental world average is a,(exp) = 116 592 059(22) x 10-11 (0.19 ppm), which represents a factor of 2 improvement in precision.},

  abstract = {We review the present status of the Standard Model calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. This is performed in a perturbative expansion in the fine-structure constant a and is broken down into pure QED, electroweak, and hadronic contributions. The pure QED contribution is by far the largest and has been evaluated up to and including O(alpha(5)) with negligible numerical uncertainty. The electroweak contribution is suppressed by (m(mu)/M-W)(2) and only shows up at the level of the seventh significant digit. It has been evaluated up to two loops and is known to better than one percent. Hadronic contributions are the most difficult to calculate and are responsible for almost all of the theoretical uncertainty. The leading hadronic contribution appears at O(alpha(2)) and is due to hadronic vacuum polarization, whereas at O(alpha(3)) the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution appears. Given the low characteristic scale of this observable, these contributions have to be calculated with nonperturbative methods, in particular, dispersion relations and the lattice approach to QCD. The largest part of this review is dedicated to a detailed account of recent efforts to improve the calculation of these two contributions with either a data-driven, dispersive approach, or a first-principle, lattice-QCD approach. The final result reads a(mu)(SM) = 116 591 810(43) x 10(-11) and is smaller than the Brookhaven measurement by 3.7 sigma. The experimental uncertainty will soon be reduced by up to a factor four by the new experiment currently running at Fermilab, and also by the future J-PARC experiment. This and the prospects to further reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the near future - which are also discussed here - make this quantity one of the most promising places to look for evidence of new physics.

  abstract = {We present the final report from a series of precision measurements of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, a(mu)=(g-2)/2. The details of the experimental method, apparatus, data taking, and analysis are summarized. Data obtained at Brookhaven National Laboratory, using nearly equal samples of positive and negative muons, were used to deduce a(mu)(Expt)=11659208.0(5.4)(3.3)x10(-10), where the statistical and systematic uncertainties are given, respectively. The combined uncertainty of 0.54 ppm represents a 14-fold improvement compared to previous measurements at CERN. The standard model value for a(mu) includes contributions from virtual QED, weak, and hadronic processes. While the QED processes account for most of the anomaly, the largest theoretical uncertainty, approximate to 0.55 ppm, is associated with first-order hadronic vacuum polarization. Present standard model evaluations, based on e(+)e(-) hadronic cross sections, lie 2.2-2.7 standard deviations below the experimental result.},

  abstract = {The standard model of particle physics describes the vast majority of experiments and observations involving elementary particles. Any deviation from its predictions would be a sign of new, fundamental physics. One long-standing discrepancy concerns the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, a measure of the magnetic field surrounding that particle. Standard-model predictions(1) exhibit disagreement with measurements(2) that is tightly scattered around 3.7 standard deviations. Today, theoretical and measurement errors are comparable; however, ongoing and planned experiments aim to reduce the measurement error by a factor of four. Theoretically, the dominant source of error is the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization (LO-HVP) contribution. For the upcoming measurements, it is essential to evaluate the prediction for this contribution with independent methods and to reduce its uncertainties. The most precise, model-independent determinations so far rely on dispersive techniques, combined with measurements of the cross-section of electron-positron annihilation into hadrons(3-6). To eliminate our reliance on these experiments, here we use ab initio quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and quantum electrodynamics simulations to compute the LO-HVP contribution. We reach sufficient precision to discriminate between the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the predictions of dispersive methods. Our result favours the experimentally measured value over those obtained using the dispersion relation. Moreover, the methods used and developed in this work will enable further increased precision as more powerful computers become available.},

  abstract = {A permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of a particle or system is a separation of charge along its angular momentum axis and is a direct signal of T violation and, assuming CPT symmetry, CP violation. For over 60 years EDMs have been studied, first as a signal of a parity-symmetry violation and then as a signal of CP violation that would clarify its role in nature and in theory. Contemporary motivations include the role that CP violation plays in explaining the cosmological matter-antimatter asymmetry and the search for new physics. Experiments on a variety of systems have become evermore sensitive, but provide only upper limits on EDMs, and theory at several scales is crucial to interpret these limits. Nuclear theory provides connections from standard-model and beyond-standard-model physics to the observable EDMs, and atomic and molecular theory reveal how CP violation is manifest in these systems. EDM results in hadronic systems require that the standard-model QCD parameter of (theta) over bar must be exceptionally small, which could be explained by the existence of axions, also a candidate dark-matter particle. Theoretical results on electroweak baryogenesis show that new physics is needed to explain the dominance of matter in the Universe. Experimental and theoretical efforts continue to expand with new ideas and new questions, and this review provides a broad overview of theoretical motivations and interpretations as well as details about experimental techniques, experiments, and prospects. The intent is to provide specifics and context as this exciting field moves forward.},

  abstract = {In the standard model for electroweak interactions, the Higgs sector is known to display a custodial symmetry protecting the mass relation m(W)(+/- 2)=m(W3)(2) from large corrections. When considering extensions of the scalar sector, this symmetry has to be introduced by hand in order to pass current electroweak precision tests in a natural way. In this Letter, we implement a generalized custodial symmetry in the two-Higgs-doublet model. Assuming the invariance of the potential under CP transformations, we prove the existence of a new custodial scenario characterized by m(H)(+/- 2)=m(H)(02) instead of m(H)(+/- 2)=m(A)(02). Consequently, the pseudoscalar A(0) may be much lighter than the charged H-+/-, giving rise to interesting phenomenology.},

In the general two Higgs doublet model that allows extra Yukawa couplings, we take a simplified approach of single enhanced coupling. We fix the charged lepton flavor violating coupling, p.,7, = pp,, via the one -loop mechanism, for illustrative masses of the heavy scalar H and pseudoscalar A, where we assume mA = Since extra top Yukawa couplings are plausibly the largest, we turn on p and find that LHC search for gg H, A -> Ty gives a more stringent bound than from r gy with the two -loop mechanism. Turning on a second extra top Yukawa coupling, p,1, can loosen the bound on p,,, but LHC constraints can again be more stringent than from B Dyv versus Del/ universality. This means that evidence for H, A -> Ty may yet emerge with full LHC Run 2 data, while direct search for r it+ bW or tH)W+ (plus conjugate) may also bear fruit.},

We focus especially on muon (and tau) EDM where in the coming decade several experiments - Muon g-2, J-PARC and PSI (and Belle II) - will push sensitivities down by several orders of magnitude. With the working assumption that extra Yukawa couplings are analogous to SM ones in strength and taking exotic scalar masses in sub-TeV range, we find that mu and tau EDM can be enhanced to values larger than new physics scenarios that scale with lepton mass. The main effect comes from the flavor-conserving extra top coupling rho(tt) via well-known two-loop diagrams. Deviating from our working assumption, if the muon g - 2 anomaly arises from the one-loop diagram, driven by singly enhanced lepton flavor violating rho(tau mu) coupling, it can also induce rather large muon EDM, accessible at upcoming experiments.},

Remarkably, in the general two Higgs doublet model (g2HDM) that possesses a second set of Yukawa matrices, one can have electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) while the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) is evaded by a natural flavor tuning that echoes the Standard Model (SM). We show that eEDM may first emerge around 10-30 e cm or so, followed by neutron EDM (nEDM) down to 10-27 e cm. We illustrate a cancellation mechanism for nEDM itself, which in turn can be probed when a facility capable of pushing down to 10-28 e cm becomes available.},

The measurement is based on a full dataset collected below 1 GeV during three data taking seasons, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 62 pb-1. In the dominant p-resonance region, a systematic uncertainty of 0.7% has been reached. At energies around 0-resonance the x-+x-- production cross section was measured for the first time with high beam energy resolution. The forward-backward charge asymmetry in the x-+x-- production has also been measured. It shows a strong deviation from the theoretical prediction based on the conventional scalar quantum electrodynamics framework, and it is in good agreement with the generalized vector-meson-dominance and dispersive-based predictions. The impact of the presented results on the evaluation of the hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of muon is discussed.},

  abstract = {Results are presented on a search for CP violation in the production and decay of top quark-antiquark pairs in the lepton+jets channel. The search is based on data from proton-proton collisions at $$ \sqrt{s} $$= 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb−1. Possible CP violation effects are evaluated by measuring asymmetries in observables constructed from linearly independent four-momentum vectors of the final-state particles. The dimensionless chromoelectric dipole moment of the top quark obtained from the observed asymmetries is measured to be 0.04 ± 0.10 (stat) ± 0.07(syst), and the asymmetries exhibit no evidence for CP-violating effects, consistent with expectations from the standard model.},

  abstract = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 2,143 new measurements from 709 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Machine Learning, and one on Spectroscopy of Light Meson Resonances.
              The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 97 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 23 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.
              The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print, as a web version optimized for use on phones, and as an Android app.},

The out‐of‐equililbrium decay scenario is reviewed and detailed numerical results are discussed. A model for the requisite CP violation within the minimal SU(5) theory (one 5 and one 24 representations of Higgs) is presented.
