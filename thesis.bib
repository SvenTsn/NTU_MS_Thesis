  abstract = {We present the first results of the Fermilab National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) Muon g - 2 Experiment for the positive muon magnetic anomaly a(mu)  (g(mu) - 2)/2. The anomaly is determined from the precision measurements of two angular frequencies. Intensity variation of high-energy positrons from muon decays directly encodes the difference frequency omega(a) between the spin-precession and cyclotron frequencies for polarized muons in a magnetic storage ring. The storage ring magnetic field is measured using nuclear magnetic resonance probes calibrated in terms of the equivalent proton spin precession frequency (omega) over tilde (p)' in a spherical water sample at 34.7 degrees C. The ratio omega(a)/(omega) over tilde (p)', together with known fundamental constants, determines a(mu)(FNAL) = 116 592 040(54) x 10(-11) (0.46 ppm). The result is 3.3 standard deviations greater than the standard model prediction and is in excellent agreement with the previous Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) E821 measurement. After combination with previous measurements of both mu(+) and mu(-), the new experimental average of a(mu)(Exp) = 116 592 061(41) x 10(-11) (0.35 ppm) increases the tension between experiment and theory to 4.2 standard deviations.},

  abstract = {We present a new measurement of the positive muon magnetic anomaly, a, equivalent to (g,- 2)/2, from the Fermilab Muon g - 2 Experiment using data collected in 2019 and 2020. We have analyzed more than 4 times the number of positrons from muon decay than in our previous result from 2018 data. The systematic error is reduced by more than a factor of 2 due to better running conditions, a more stable beam, and improved knowledge of the magnetic field weighted by the muon distribution, w similar to ip, and of the anomalous precession frequency corrected for beam dynamics effects, wa. From the ratio wa/w similar to ip, together with precisely determined external parameters, we determine a, = 116 592 057(25) x 10-11 (0.21 ppm). Combining this result with our previous result from the 2018 data, we obtain a,(FNAL) = 116592055(24) x 10-11 (0.20 ppm). The new experimental world average is a,(exp) = 116 592 059(22) x 10-11 (0.19 ppm), which represents a factor of 2 improvement in precision.},

  abstract = {We review the present status of the Standard Model calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. This is performed in a perturbative expansion in the fine-structure constant a and is broken down into pure QED, electroweak, and hadronic contributions. The pure QED contribution is by far the largest and has been evaluated up to and including O(alpha(5)) with negligible numerical uncertainty. The electroweak contribution is suppressed by (m(mu)/M-W)(2) and only shows up at the level of the seventh significant digit. It has been evaluated up to two loops and is known to better than one percent. Hadronic contributions are the most difficult to calculate and are responsible for almost all of the theoretical uncertainty. The leading hadronic contribution appears at O(alpha(2)) and is due to hadronic vacuum polarization, whereas at O(alpha(3)) the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution appears. Given the low characteristic scale of this observable, these contributions have to be calculated with nonperturbative methods, in particular, dispersion relations and the lattice approach to QCD. The largest part of this review is dedicated to a detailed account of recent efforts to improve the calculation of these two contributions with either a data-driven, dispersive approach, or a first-principle, lattice-QCD approach. The final result reads a(mu)(SM) = 116 591 810(43) x 10(-11) and is smaller than the Brookhaven measurement by 3.7 sigma. The experimental uncertainty will soon be reduced by up to a factor four by the new experiment currently running at Fermilab, and also by the future J-PARC experiment. This and the prospects to further reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the near future - which are also discussed here - make this quantity one of the most promising places to look for evidence of new physics.

  abstract = {We present the final report from a series of precision measurements of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, a(mu)=(g-2)/2. The details of the experimental method, apparatus, data taking, and analysis are summarized. Data obtained at Brookhaven National Laboratory, using nearly equal samples of positive and negative muons, were used to deduce a(mu)(Expt)=11659208.0(5.4)(3.3)x10(-10), where the statistical and systematic uncertainties are given, respectively. The combined uncertainty of 0.54 ppm represents a 14-fold improvement compared to previous measurements at CERN. The standard model value for a(mu) includes contributions from virtual QED, weak, and hadronic processes. While the QED processes account for most of the anomaly, the largest theoretical uncertainty, approximate to 0.55 ppm, is associated with first-order hadronic vacuum polarization. Present standard model evaluations, based on e(+)e(-) hadronic cross sections, lie 2.2-2.7 standard deviations below the experimental result.},

  abstract = {The standard model of particle physics describes the vast majority of experiments and observations involving elementary particles. Any deviation from its predictions would be a sign of new, fundamental physics. One long-standing discrepancy concerns the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, a measure of the magnetic field surrounding that particle. Standard-model predictions(1) exhibit disagreement with measurements(2) that is tightly scattered around 3.7 standard deviations. Today, theoretical and measurement errors are comparable; however, ongoing and planned experiments aim to reduce the measurement error by a factor of four. Theoretically, the dominant source of error is the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization (LO-HVP) contribution. For the upcoming measurements, it is essential to evaluate the prediction for this contribution with independent methods and to reduce its uncertainties. The most precise, model-independent determinations so far rely on dispersive techniques, combined with measurements of the cross-section of electron-positron annihilation into hadrons(3-6). To eliminate our reliance on these experiments, here we use ab initio quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and quantum electrodynamics simulations to compute the LO-HVP contribution. We reach sufficient precision to discriminate between the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the predictions of dispersive methods. Our result favours the experimentally measured value over those obtained using the dispersion relation. Moreover, the methods used and developed in this work will enable further increased precision as more powerful computers become available.},

  abstract = {A permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of a particle or system is a separation of charge along its angular momentum axis and is a direct signal of T violation and, assuming CPT symmetry, CP violation. For over 60 years EDMs have been studied, first as a signal of a parity-symmetry violation and then as a signal of CP violation that would clarify its role in nature and in theory. Contemporary motivations include the role that CP violation plays in explaining the cosmological matter-antimatter asymmetry and the search for new physics. Experiments on a variety of systems have become evermore sensitive, but provide only upper limits on EDMs, and theory at several scales is crucial to interpret these limits. Nuclear theory provides connections from standard-model and beyond-standard-model physics to the observable EDMs, and atomic and molecular theory reveal how CP violation is manifest in these systems. EDM results in hadronic systems require that the standard-model QCD parameter of (theta) over bar must be exceptionally small, which could be explained by the existence of axions, also a candidate dark-matter particle. Theoretical results on electroweak baryogenesis show that new physics is needed to explain the dominance of matter in the Universe. Experimental and theoretical efforts continue to expand with new ideas and new questions, and this review provides a broad overview of theoretical motivations and interpretations as well as details about experimental techniques, experiments, and prospects. The intent is to provide specifics and context as this exciting field moves forward.},

  abstract = {In the standard model for electroweak interactions, the Higgs sector is known to display a custodial symmetry protecting the mass relation m(W)(+/- 2)=m(W3)(2) from large corrections. When considering extensions of the scalar sector, this symmetry has to be introduced by hand in order to pass current electroweak precision tests in a natural way. In this Letter, we implement a generalized custodial symmetry in the two-Higgs-doublet model. Assuming the invariance of the potential under CP transformations, we prove the existence of a new custodial scenario characterized by m(H)(+/- 2)=m(H)(02) instead of m(H)(+/- 2)=m(A)(02). Consequently, the pseudoscalar A(0) may be much lighter than the charged H-+/-, giving rise to interesting phenomenology.},

In the general two Higgs doublet model that allows extra Yukawa couplings, we take a simplified approach of single enhanced coupling. We fix the charged lepton flavor violating coupling, p.,7, = pp,, via the one -loop mechanism, for illustrative masses of the heavy scalar H and pseudoscalar A, where we assume mA = Since extra top Yukawa couplings are plausibly the largest, we turn on p and find that LHC search for gg H, A -> Ty gives a more stringent bound than from r gy with the two -loop mechanism. Turning on a second extra top Yukawa coupling, p,1, can loosen the bound on p,,, but LHC constraints can again be more stringent than from B Dyv versus Del/ universality. This means that evidence for H, A -> Ty may yet emerge with full LHC Run 2 data, while direct search for r it+ bW or tH)W+ (plus conjugate) may also bear fruit.},

We focus especially on muon (and tau) EDM where in the coming decade several experiments - Muon g-2, J-PARC and PSI (and Belle II) - will push sensitivities down by several orders of magnitude. With the working assumption that extra Yukawa couplings are analogous to SM ones in strength and taking exotic scalar masses in sub-TeV range, we find that mu and tau EDM can be enhanced to values larger than new physics scenarios that scale with lepton mass. The main effect comes from the flavor-conserving extra top coupling rho(tt) via well-known two-loop diagrams. Deviating from our working assumption, if the muon g - 2 anomaly arises from the one-loop diagram, driven by singly enhanced lepton flavor violating rho(tau mu) coupling, it can also induce rather large muon EDM, accessible at upcoming experiments.},

Remarkably, in the general two Higgs doublet model (g2HDM) that possesses a second set of Yukawa matrices, one can have electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) while the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM) is evaded by a natural flavor tuning that echoes the Standard Model (SM). We show that eEDM may first emerge around 10-30 e cm or so, followed by neutron EDM (nEDM) down to 10-27 e cm. We illustrate a cancellation mechanism for nEDM itself, which in turn can be probed when a facility capable of pushing down to 10-28 e cm becomes available.},

The measurement is based on a full dataset collected below 1 GeV during three data taking seasons, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 62 pb-1. In the dominant p-resonance region, a systematic uncertainty of 0.7% has been reached. At energies around 0-resonance the x-+x-- production cross section was measured for the first time with high beam energy resolution. The forward-backward charge asymmetry in the x-+x-- production has also been measured. It shows a strong deviation from the theoretical prediction based on the conventional scalar quantum electrodynamics framework, and it is in good agreement with the generalized vector-meson-dominance and dispersive-based predictions. The impact of the presented results on the evaluation of the hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of muon is discussed.},

  abstract = {Results are presented on a search for CP violation in the production and decay of top quark-antiquark pairs in the lepton+jets channel. The search is based on data from proton-proton collisions at $$ \sqrt{s} $$= 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb−1. Possible CP violation effects are evaluated by measuring asymmetries in observables constructed from linearly independent four-momentum vectors of the final-state particles. The dimensionless chromoelectric dipole moment of the top quark obtained from the observed asymmetries is measured to be 0.04 ± 0.10 (stat) ± 0.07(syst), and the asymmetries exhibit no evidence for CP-violating effects, consistent with expectations from the standard model.},

  abstract = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 2,143 new measurements from 709 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Machine Learning, and one on Spectroscopy of Light Meson Resonances.
              The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 97 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 23 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.
              The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print, as a web version optimized for use on phones, and as an Android app.},

The goal of our experiment is to measure a(mu) and d(mu) using an independent method with a factor of 10 lower muon momentum, and a factor of 20 smaller diameter storage-ring solenoid compared with previous and ongoing muon g - 2 experiments with unprecedented quality of the storage magnetic field. Additional significant differences from the present experimental method include a factor of 1000 smaller transverse emittance of the muon beam (reaccelerated thermal muon beam), its efficient vertical injection into the solenoid, and tracking each decay positron from muon decay to obtain its momentum vector. The precision goal for a(mu) is a statistical uncertainty of 450 parts per billion (ppb), similar to the present experimental uncertainty, and a systematic uncertainty less than 70 ppb. The goal for EDM is a sensitivity of 1.5 x 10(-21) e.cm.},

  abstract = {This letter of intent proposes an experiment to search for an electric dipole moment of the muon based on the frozen-spin technique. We intend to exploit the high electric field, $E=1{\rm GV/m}$, experienced in the rest frame of the muon with a momentum of $p=125 {\rm MeV/}c$ when passing through a large magnetic field of $|\vec{B}|=3{\rm T}$. Current muon fluxes at the $\mu$E1 beam line permit an improved search with a sensitivity of $\sigma(d_\mu)\leq 6\times10^{-23}e{\rm cm}$, about three orders of magnitude more sensitivity than for the current upper limit of $|d_\mu|\leq1.8\times10^{-19}e{\rm cm}$\,(C.L. 95\%). With the advent of the new high intensity muon beam, HIMB, and the cold muon source, muCool, at PSI the sensitivity of the search could be further improved by tailoring a re-acceleration scheme to match the experiments injection phase space. While a null result would set a significantly improved upper limit on an otherwise un-constrained Wilson coefficient, the discovery of a muon EDM would corroborate the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model.},

  abstract = {The standard model of particle physics accurately describes all particle physics measurements made so far in the laboratory. However, it is unable to answer many questions that arise from cosmological observations, such as the nature of dark matter and why matter dominates over antimatter throughout the Universe. Theories that contain particles and interactions beyond the standard model, such as models that incorporate supersymmetry, may explain these phenomena. Such particles appear in the vacuum and interact with common particles to modify their properties. For example, the existence of very massive particles whose interactions violate time-reversal symmetry, which could explain the cosmological matter-antimatter asymmetry, can give rise to an electric dipole moment along the spin axis of the electron. No electric dipole moments of fundamental particles have been observed. However, dipole moments only slightly smaller than the current experimental bounds have been predicted to arise from particles more massive than any known to exist. Here we present an improved experimental limit on the electric dipole moment of the electron, obtained by measuring the electron spin precession in a superposition of quantum states of electrons subjected to a huge intramolecular electric field. The sensitivity of our measurement is more than one order of magnitude better than any previous measurement. This result implies that a broad class of conjectured particles, if they exist and time -reversal symmetry is maximally violated, have masses that greatly exceed what can be measured directly at the Large Hadron Collider.},

  abstract = {We reconsider the issue of the search for a nonzero electric dipole form factor (EDM) d(tau)(s) using optimal observables in tau(+)tau(-) production by e(+)e(-) collisions in the center-of-mass energy range from the tau-pair threshold to about root s similar to 15 GeV. We discuss the general formalism of optimal observables and apply it to two CP-odd observables that are sensitive to the real and imaginary part of d(tau)(s), respectively. We compute the expectation values and covariances of these optimal CP observables for tau-pair production at root s = 10.58 GeV with subsequent decays of tau(+/-) into major leptonic or semihadronic modes. For the tau decays to two pions and three charged pions we take the full kinematic information of the hadronic system into account. Assuming that the Belle II experiment at the KEKB accelerator will eventually analyze data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 50 ab(-1) and applying acceptance cuts on the final-state pions, we find that 1 s.d. sensitivities delta Red(tau) = 6.8 x 10(-20) e cm and delta Imd(tau) = 4.0 x 10(-20) e cm can be obtained with events where both tau's decay semihadronically. We consider also the ideal case that no cuts on the final-state particles are applied. With 50 ab(-1) at root s = 10.58 GeV corresponding to 4.5 x 10(10) tau(+)tau(-) events we find the 1 s.d. sensitivities delta Red(tau) = 5.8 x 10(-20) e cm and delta Imd(tau) = 3.2 x 10(-20) e cm, again for events where both tau leptons decay semihadronically. Furthermore, we analyze the potential magnitude of the tau EDM form factor in the type-II two-Higgs doublet extension and in two scalar leptoquark extensions of the Standard Model, taking into account phenomenological constraints.},

  abstract = {Given current discrepancy in muon g - 2 and future dedicated efforts to measure muon electric dipole moment (EDM) d(mu), we assess the indirect constraints imposed on d(mu) by the EDM measurements performed with heavy atoms and molecules. We notice that the dominant muon EDM effect arises via the muon-loop induced "light-by-light" CP-odd amplitude proportional to BE3, and in the vicinity of a large nucleus the corresponding parameter of expansion can be significant, eE(nucl)/m(mu)(2) similar to 2 0.04. We compute the d(mu)-induced Schiff moment of the Hg-19(9) nucleus, and the linear combination of d(e) and semileptonic C-S operator (dominant in this case) that determine the CP-odd effects in the ThO molecule. The results, d(mu)(Hg-199) < 6 x 10(-20) e cm and d(mu) (ThO) < 2 x 10(-20) e cm, constitute approximately threefold and ninefold improvements over the limits on d(mu) extracted from the Brookhaven National Laboratory muon beam experiment.},

  abstract = {We discuss theoretical and phenomenological aspects of two-Higgs-doublet extensions of the Standard Model. In general, these extensions have scalar mediated flavour changing neutral currents which are strongly constrained by experiment. Various strategies are discussed to control these flavour changing scalar currents and their phenomenological consequences are analysed. In particular, scenarios with natural flavour conservation are investigated, including the so-called type I and type II models as well as lepton-specific and inert models. Type III models are then discussed, where scalar flavour changing neutral currents are present at tree level, but are suppressed by either a specific ansatz for the Yukawa couplings or by the introduction of family symmetries leading to a natural suppression mechanism. We also consider the phenomenology of charged scalars in these models. Next we turn to the role of symmetries in the scalar sector. We discuss the six symmetry-constrained scalar potentials and their extension into the fermion sector. The vacuum structure of the scalar potential is analysed, including a study of the vacuum stability conditions on the potential and the renormalization-group improvement of these conditions is also presented. The stability of the tree level minimum of the scalar potential in connection with electric charge conservation and its behaviour under CP is analysed. The question of CP violation is addressed in detail, including the cases of explicit CP violation and spontaneous CP violation. We present a detailed study of weak basis invariants which are odd under CP. These invariants allow for the possibility of studying the CP properties of any two-Higgs-doublet model in an arbitrary Higgs basis. A careful study of spontaneous CP violation is presented, including an analysis of the conditions which have to be satisfied in order for a vacuum to violate CP. We present minimal models of CP violation where the vacuum phase is sufficient to generate a complex CKM matrix, which is at present a requirement for any realistic model of spontaneous CP violation.

  abstract = {Three independent searches for an electric dipole moment (EDM) of the positive and negative muons have been performed, using spin precession data from the muon g - 2 storage ring at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Details on the experimental apparatus and the three analyses are presented. Since the individual results on the positive and negative muons, as well as the combined result, d(mu) = (0.0 +/- 0.9) x 10(-19)e cm, are all consistent with zero, we set a new muon EDM limit, vertical bar d(mu)vertical bar < 1.8 x 10(-19)e cm (95% C.L.). This represents a factor of 5 improvement over the previous best limit on the muon EDM.},

  abstract = {We present a general analysis of extensions of the Standard Model which satisfy the criterion of Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV). We define this general framework by constructing a low-energy effective theory containing the Standard Model fields, with one or two Higgs doublets and, as the only source of SU(3)(5) flavour symmetry breaking, the background values of fields transforming under the flavour group as the ordinary Yukawa couplings. We analyse present bounds on the effective scale of dimension-six operators, which range between 1 and 10 TeV, with the most stringent constraints imposed by B --> X(s)gamma. In this class of theories, it is possible to relate predictions for FCNC processes in B physics to those in K physics. We compare the sensitivity of various experimental searches in probing the hypothesis of MFV. Within the two-Higgs-doublet scenario, we develop a general procedure to obtain all tan beta-enhanced Higgs-mediated FCNC amplitudes, discussing in particular their impact in B --> l(+)l(-), DeltaM(B) and B --> X(s)gamma. As a byproduct, we derive some two-loop tan beta-enhanced supersymmetric contributions to B --> X(s)gamma previously unknown. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {With the long-standing tension between experiment and standard-model (SM) prediction in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, a(mu)= (g - 2)(mu)/2, at the level of 3-4 sigma, it is natural to ask if there could be a sizable effect in the electric dipole moment (EDM) d(mu) as well. In this context it has often been argued that in UV complete models the electron EDM, which is very precisely measured, excludes a large effect in d(mu). However, the recently observed 2.5 sigma tension in a(e) = (g - 2)(e)/2, if confirmed, requires that the muon and electron sectors effectively decouple to avoid constraints from mu -> e gamma. We briefly discuss UV complete models that possess such a decoupling, which can be enforced by an Abelian flavor symmetry L-mu - L-tau. We show that, in such scenarios, there is no reason to expect a correlation between the electron and muon EDM, so that the latter can be sizable. New limits on d(mu) improved by up to two orders of magnitude are expected from the upcoming (g - 2)(mu), experiments at Fermilab and J-PARC. Beyond, a proposed dedicated muon EDM experiment at PSI could further advance the limit. In this way, future improved measurements of a(e), a(mu), as well as the fine-structure constant alpha are not only set to provide exciting precision tests of the SM, but, in combination with EDMs, to reveal crucial insights into the flavor structure of physics beyond the SM.},

Our measurement stands in the long history of EDM experiments probing physics violating time-reversal invariance. The salient features of this experiment were the use of a Hg-199 comagnetometer and an array of optically pumped cesium vapor magnetometers to cancel and correct for magnetic-field changes. The statistical analysis was performed on blinded datasets by two separate groups, while the estimation of systematic effects profited from an unprecedented knowledge of the magnetic field.

In a two Higgs doublet model, the first-order phase transition can be strong enough to allow the electroweak baryogenesis due to the effect of extra Higgs bosons. We investigate the quantum correction to the triple coupling of the lightest Higgs boson in such a scenario, and find that the condition of the strong first-order phase transition necessarily leads to the deviation of at least 10% from the Standard Model prediction. Such magnitude of the deviation can be identified in future e(+)e(-) linear collider experiments. We also discuss the minimal supersymrnetric standard model with the light stop scenario, and point out that a sizable correction appears in the triple coupling for successful electroweak baryogenesis.

We can account for the observed baryon asymmetry, provided new CP-violating phases are greater than similar to 10(-2)-10(-4) and some superpartners are light enough to be relevant during the transition, which takes place at a temperature of 50-100 GeV. In one case, the light superpartners are the top squarks and the charginos and/or the neutralinos; in another case the top squarks and both Higgs doublets are light. Our calculation is easily extended to the case of a general two Higgs model, where we find sufficient baryogenesis provided that a certain combination of parameters in the Higgs potential leads to a CP-violating space-dependent phase in the top quark mass of order 10(-3).},

Previous efforts have focused on the current for the difference of the two Higgsino fields, H-1 - H-2 as the source of biasing sphalerons to create the baryon asymmetry. We point out that the current for the orthogonal linear combination, H-1 + H-2, is larger by several orders of magnitude.

  abstract = {This paper presents the first cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We find that the Planck spectra at high multipoles (l greater than or similar to 40) are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter ACDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be theta* = (1.04147 +/- 0.00062) x 10(-2), Omega(b)h(2) = 0.02205 +/- 0.00028, Omega(c)h(2) = 0.1199 +/- 0.0027, and n(s) = 0.9603 +/- 0.0073, respectively (note that in this abstract we quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we find a low value of the Hubble constant, H-0 = (67.3 +/- 1.2) km s(-1) Mpc(-1), and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega(m) = 0.315 +/- 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H-0 and the magnitude-redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter ACDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter ACDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find an upper limit of r(0.002) < 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N-eff = 3.30 +/- 0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N-eff = 3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w = -1.13(-0.10)(+0.13). We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the fine-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic fields. Despite the success of the six-parameter ACDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 less than or similar to l less than or similar to 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies.
              The poor fit to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive significance, but is an "anomaly" in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

By scrutinizing the heavy Higgs boson mass spectrum, regions satisfying both strong first-order electroweak phase transition and the muon g - 2 anomaly are identified.

In the general two Higgs doublet model with extra Yukawa couplings, we show that all these processes probe the lepton flavor violating (LFV) dipole transition that arises from the two loop mechanism, with scalarinduced contact terms subdominant. This is because existing data suggest the extra Yukawa couplings rho(mu e), rho(ee) <= lambda(e), while rho(tau mu), rho(tau tau) less than or similar to lambda(tau), and rho(tt) less than or similar to tau(t) with lambda(i) the usual Yukawa coupling of the Standard Model (SM), where rho(mu e)rho(tt) and rho(tau mu)rho(tt) enter the mu e gamma and tau mu gamma two loop amplitudes, respectively. With the B-s -> mu mu decay rate basically consistent with SM expectation, together with the B-s mixing constraint, we show that B-s -> tau tau would also be consistent with SM, while B-s -> tau mu and B -> K tau mu decays would be out of reach of projected sensitivities, in strong contrast with some models motivated by the B anomalies.},

  abstract = {The LHC has not discovered any New Physics beyond the anticipated h(125) boson, and new ideas abound for out-of-the-box searches, or Effective Field Theories with multi-TeV cutoff. But, have we exhausted dimension-4 operators involving sub-TeV particles that are not exotic (non-XLP)? We advocate the existence of an extra Higgs doublet that carry extra Weinberg couplings, where emergent mass-mixing hierarchies and alignment have hidden their effects very well so far. 0(1) Higgs quartics can induce first order electroweak phase transition and imply sub-TeV H, A, H-+/- spectrum. The extra Weinberg couplings, led by rho(tt) and rho(tc) at O(1), can drive electroweak baryogenesis, while |rho(ee)/rho(tt)| proportional to lambda(e)/lambda(t), the ratio of usual electron and top Weinberg couplings, can tame electron EDM. Finding these extra Higgs bosons via cg -> tH/A -> tt <(c) over bar >, tt <(t) over bar > and cg -> bH(+) bt <(b) over bar processes (and those allowed by Higgs boson splittings) at the LHC, and pushing the flavor frontier to break the flavor code, would usher in a new Higgs/flavor era. A new scale at 10-20 TeV, possibly related to the Landau pole of the scalar sector, may emerge.},

  abstract = {Electric dipole moments are extremely sensitive probes for additional sources of CP violation in new physics models. Specifically, they have been argued in the past to exclude new CP-violating phases in two-Higgs-doublet models. Since recently models including such phases have been discussed widely, we revisit the available constraints in the presence of mechanisms which are typically invoked to evade flavour-changing neutral currents. To that aim, we start by assessing the necessary calculations on the hadronic, nuclear and atomic/molecular level, deriving expressions with conservative error estimates. Their phenomenological analysis in the context of two-Higgs-doublet models yields strong constraints, in some cases weakened by a cancellation mechanism among contributions from neutral scalars. While the corresponding parameter combinations do not yet have to be unnaturally small, the constraints are likely to preclude large effects in other CP-violating observables. Nevertheless, the generically expected contributions to electric dipole moments in this class of models lie within the projected sensitivity of the next-generation experiments.},

  abstract = {We revisit the calculation of the electron, neutron, and proton electric dipole moments (EDMs) in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM). The relatively large mass of the Higgs boson, m(H) similar or equal to 125 GeV coupled with the (as yet) lack of discovery of any supersymmetric particle at the LHC, has pushed the supersymmetry breaking scale to several TeV or higher. Though one might expect this decoupling to have relaxed completely any bounds on the two CP violating phases in the CMSSM (theta(mu) and theta(A)), the impressive experimental improvements in the limits on the EDMs (particularly the electron EDM) still allow us to set constraints of order (0.01-0.1)pi on theta(A) and (0.001-0.1)pi on theta(mu). We also discuss the impact of future improvements in the experimental limits on supersymmetric models.},

  abstract = {Weak and electromagnetic interactions of the leptons are examined under the hypothesis that the weak interactions are mediated by vector bosons. With only an isotopic triplet of leptons coupled to a triplet of vector bosons (two charged decay-intermediaries and the photon) the theory possesses no partial-symmetries. Such symmetries may be established if additional vector bosons or additional leptons are introduced. Since the latter possibility yields a theory disagreeing with experiment, the simplest partially-symmetric model reproducing the observed electromagnetic and weak interactions of leptons requires the existence of at least four vector-boson fields (including the photon). Corresponding partially-conserved quantities suggest leptonic analogues to the conserved quantities associated with strong interactions: strangeness and isobaric spin.},

The search is performed in five decay modes: γγ, ZZ, W+W−, τ+τ−, and bb¯. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, γγ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3±0.4(stat.)±0.5(syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.},

  abstract = {A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton–proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb−1 collected at s=7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb−1 at s=8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H→ZZ(⁎)→4ℓ, H→γγ and H→WW(⁎)→eνμν in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H→ZZ(⁎), WW(⁎), bb¯ and τ+τ− in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H→ZZ(⁎)→4ℓ and H→γγ channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0±0.4(stat)±0.4(sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7×10−9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson.},
