# EDM in g2HDM thesis outline

## Introduction
- Motivation
  - Unanswered questions in HEP
  - Limitations of the current leading model (SM)
  - What extra good does g2HDM bring?
  - EDM as a precision probe of NP

## The theoretical framework
### A review of the Standard Model of particle physics
- Field-theoretic framework
- An overview of SM group structure, particles, and interactions 

### g2HDM
- g2HDM as a natural extension of the SM
  - What differentiates it from other (similar) models?
- The Lagrangian and Yukawa structure
- How various parameters in the theory can contribute to NP

### EDM
- EDM theory in the context of particle physics
- The Lagrangian and model-independent approach (Wilson coefficients?)
- Current status of EDM experiments

## My analyses
### Lepton EDM
- How g2HDM contributes to lepton-EDM
  - One-loop
  - Two-loop Barr-Zee
- Results
  - For "double-checking" my calculations are valid (and for completeness), reference key results and plots of Prof. Hou 2020 paper
  - c.f. our 2022 JHEP paper for $\mu$ and $\tau$
  - muon
    - One-loop does not produce sizeable contribution to EDM, but is a driving factor for g-2. <span style="color:blue">Mention plot in paper? Girish made the g-2 plot, I don't have code written for that (yet)</span>
    - Two-loop still at least three orders of magnitude below experimental bound. <span style="color:blue">Plot $|d_{\mu}| v.s. |\rho_{tt}|$</span>
  - Tau
    - Not even remotely close to experimental bounds. <span style="color:blue">Plot $|d_{\tau}| v.s. |\rho_{tt}|$</span>
- Summary of the results
  - Both muon and tau are currently "out of reach" by a long shot

### Quark EDM
- How g2HDM contributes to lepton-EDM
  - One-loop
  - Two-loop Barr-Zee
  - Weinberg
- Results
  - c.f. current CEDM project paper
- Summary and analysis of the results

## Conclusion and discussion
- Summary of motivation
- Summary of theoretical framework
- Summary of the analyses
- Future prospects
