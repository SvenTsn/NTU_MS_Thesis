\chapter{The General Two-Higgs Doublet Model}
\label{ch:g2HDM}

Following Gell-Mann's \textit{Totalitaian principle}, as a natural extension to the SM, we can introduce a second Higgs doublet.
This second doublet couples to all flavors and families of fermions, and has no symmetry requirement imposed upon it.
Hence, it is referred to as the "General Two Higgs Doublet Model", or {\gthdm} for short.

The {\gthdm} Lagrangian can be written as~\cite{DavidsonHaber05, HouModak21}
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L} = - & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sum_{f = u, d, \ell} \bar f_{i} \Big[\big(-\lambda^f_i \delta_{ij} s_\gamma + \rho^f_{ij} c_\gamma\big) h
  + \big(\lambda^f_i \delta_{ij} c_\gamma + \rho^f_{ij} s_\gamma\big)H
  - i\,{\rm sgn}(Q_f) \rho^f_{ij} A\Big]  R\, f_{j} \nonumber                                                                                     \\
  -               & \bar{u}_i\left[(V\rho^d)_{ij} R-(\rho^{u\dagger}V)_{ij} L\right]d_j H^+
  - \bar{\nu}_i\rho^L_{ij} R \, \ell_j H^+ + {\rm h.c.},
  \label{eq:lagrangian}
\end{align}
where the generation indices \(i \), \(j \) are summed over, \(L \), \(R = (1\pm\gamma_{5})/2\) are projections, \(V \) is the CKM matrix for quarks and unity for leptons.
\(\lambda^f \) are the SM Yukawa matrices, and \(\rho^f \) are the extra-Yukawa matrices.
A key takeaway is that each family of fermions (u-type, d-type, lepton) is associated with its own extra-Yukawa \(\rho \) matrix.
In this scenario, flavor-changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) processes are controlled by \textit{flavor hierarchies} and \textit{alignment}.
Flavor hierarchies means that the \(\rho \) matrices somehow ``know'' the current flavor structure of the SM, represented by the ``rule of thumb''~\cite{HouKumar20}
\begin{equation}
  \rho_{ii} \lesssim \order{\lambda_i}, \quad
  \rho_{1i} \lesssim \order{\lambda_1}, \quad
  \rho_{3j} \lesssim \order{\lambda_3},
  \label{eq:ruleofthumb}
\end{equation}
with \(j\neq 1 \).
Alignment means that \(c_{\gamma} \equiv \cos\gamma = \cos(\beta-\alpha)\) is small.
Consequently, the SM-like Higgs \(h \) is mostly controlled by the SM Yukawas, while the newly introduced \(\rho \) matrices control the exotic Higgses \(H, A, H^{\pm} \).
A remarkable feature of {\gthdm} is that \(\order{1}\,\rho_{tt}\) can drive EWBG through~\cite{FSH18} \(\lambda_{t}\Im\rho_{tt} \).
