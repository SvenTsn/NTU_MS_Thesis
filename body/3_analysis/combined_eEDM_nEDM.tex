\chapter{Combined Analysis of {\eedm} and {\nedm}}
\label{ch:combined-eEDM-nEDM}

as well as combined results for {\eedm} and {\nedm} in the range \(r \in [0.6, 0.8] \) in \figref{fig:nEDM-eEDM}.
In the combined plot, the {\eedm} cancellation mechanism from the previous section at \(r \approx 0.7 \) is clearly illustrated.
The interplay of the {\nedm} and the {\eedm} in \figref{fig:nEDM-eEDM} shows that our predictions are of notable significance in both precision observables.
