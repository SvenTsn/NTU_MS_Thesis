\label{ch:conclusion}

Some comments, perhaps regarding the masses and degeneracy of the heavy Higgses.

We present an analysis of various EDMs of fundamental particles in the framework of a {\gthdm}.
We note that to evade precision bounds while satisfying the conditions for baryogenesis, a cancellation is possible,
which is also an indicator of an underlying \textit{flavor hierarchy}.
This is most prevalent in eEDM, where bounds are the strongest, and experimental precision improving rapidly.
We analyze muEDM, with our predictions still being a couple orders of magnitude below current experimental bounds.
% Comment on interplay with muon g-2.
We present results for tauEDM, but provide no further analysis since the bounds are still too imprecise.
We analyze quark EDM through nEDM, and optain promising prospective results, especially when viewed together with eEDM.
We stress that this is a noteworthy area to pay attention to in the upcoming decade or two.
