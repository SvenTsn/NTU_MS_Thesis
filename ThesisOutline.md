# EDM in g2HDM thesis outline

## Motivation (The "why"s)
- Why g2HDM? What differentiates it from other (similar) models? Why is $\rho_{tt}$ important?
- Why EDMs? What makes it a relevant point of discussion/parameter of interest?

## The theoretical framework
- The nitty-gritty of the g2HDM model, its assumptions and parameters
- The relevant framework required to discuss EDM
  - One-loop
  - Two-loop
  - Quarks and leptons

## Predictions and analysis
- Lepton EDM (and $g-2$)
- Quark EDM $\rightarrow$ Neutron and top EDMs

## Conclusion and discussion
- Precision measurement prospects
- Collider interplay/prospects
